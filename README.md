# AKKA Features
## Summary
I have created few small programs to demonstrate AKKA concepts and features

### Hello World
This example shows 
- Akka System and Actor creation happens in the background
- Message are sent and control comes back to main code
- You can terminate Actor by sending PoisonPill
- After Actor is terminated, further messages will go to deadletter queue
- You can create multiple system within the same program
- Once we shutdown the systems then code comes to an end, otherwise it hangs for further instructions


### Ref Path Selection 
This example shows 
- Actor can be referenced by actorref
- Actor can be referenced by absolute path
- Actor can be referenced by relative path, but only inside of an another actor
- Actor can pring its absolute path

### State
This example shows 
- We can set our state info at the instanciation
- State can changed only within the actor and each actor maintains separately
- Actor cannot be restarted unless supervission is implemented 

### Actor Life Cycle
This example shows 
- There 4 methods that we can override 
- preStart happens when the actor is started
- postStop happens when the actor is stopped
- preRestart happens before actor gets restarted
- postRestart happens after the actor gets restarted
- Note: restart re initializes the state, to save it we need to do it at preRestart point to persitant storage
- Note: When actor fails default supervission is to restart the actor


### Parent Child
This example shows 
- Parent created child, then child created the sub child
- We can send message from parent to sub child directly
- We can kill the child, but sub child is not killed
- We can still send message to sub child 
- Selection seem to be restricted to only one level, I may be wrong

### Supervision
This example shows 
- In this example there is a GaurdianActor which creates the system and starts the parent actor
- Then GaurdianActor instructs parent actor to start child actor
- Then GaurdianActor instructs parent actor to send a Throw message to child actor
- Then child actor Throws StopException, this causes parent to stop the child and if we try to reach child we could not, message gets sent to dead letter
- Basically we cannot control GaurdianActor supervision strategy
- We can control rest of the tree in the Actor hierarchy and at each level we can set supervision strategy
- We need to note that if we restart parent then all child gets started

### Become UnBecome
This example shows 
- Basically Actor can have different behaviour in terms of what message to honor and at what point 
- You can declare multiple 'receive' sections and switch between them
- Use case would be when the Actor gets started first time and gets a message to process for the first 
  time we could do database connections and process the message, all subsequent messages can be processed 
  without reestablishing the database connection
- In this example some of the messages gets ignored if the behaviour is changed 

### FSM
This example shows 
- This is similar become/unbecome
- No receive function declared, it is handled by a different method called Events
- I don't see much difference 

### Timers and Scheduler
This example shows 
- An actor can call itself (via generating messages periodically)
- Scheduler can also be used, but Timers is preferred
- PoisonPill will stop the cycle

### Persistence
This is little bit tricky, if you get the trick it is no big deal
- The key point to understand is, AKKA is persisting only the commands, not the state. In order to arrive correct state, application need to be coded to recover back from the journal
- It recovers not only upon failure but also on regular shutdown and restart!!
- On each start it looks at the journal and recovers all the commands to get to the right state (if you have any external variables, this could be a problem, if it is a pure function with no side effects then this will work okay)
- By storing commands, we control what comands to be stored
- Journal holds all the commands but if you take a snapshot then Journal is only played from the snapshot and forward

In this example:
- I created a simple state variable of Int type
- I send a command to increment by 1, this gets persisted in the journal and gets applied to the state variable
- I also send a snap message to take a snapshot of my Int varibale, this can also be a complex object with several struct data type with name=value pair
- When the actor fails, upon restart it recovers from journal
- When the actor is shutdown due to system shut down even tnen it recovers


### Remote Actor Lookup
Actor Systems can be created in local mode or in remote mode. In remote mode each actor system need to run on a separate port same machine or same port different machine. Actor system name can be same or different, it does not matter. 

Typically same code will be deployed on all nodes. 

In order for an actor to send message to another actor, the actor sending the message need to know absolute path. 


In this example:
I have created two sections in Application.conf file

Create two systems using different configuration sections with different port numbers

First system has one actor

Second system know the full path of the first system and actor name, using this I have send an message and it worked 

I also tried with 127.0.0.1 address and AWS EC2 local IP address, it worked

I also tried deploying the same code to new physical server with two different local IP, it worked, no difference

I also tried with same system name, made no difference

Finally I tried to connect two nodes to a third node, third node received messages from both, all had the same actor system name

Note: As soon as we send a message, two systems establish a link relationship and start communiting heartbeat, if the second is killed, then first system marks the second system in 'Gated' state, when the second system is restated and sends a message then first system restores the link state to 'Active'...clustering happens !!


### Remote Actor Creation
Actor systems can run on different node. 

One system can request another system on a different node to create an actor. 

What I have done here is, created system1 and system2 on two different nodes, system1 will ask system2 to create an actor in system2 node. The actor class need to be on both systems, but when the actor is created it is getting created with the actor version that is residing on system2 (i.e., no class transport from system1). Typically we should not have class version differences in this use case. 

Once an actor is created in system2, system1 gets actorRef and can use it to send messages. 

One part confused me is "when I printed self address of the actor which is running in system2 but it printed with system1 address and port number"...I have no idea about the implementation reason!!!

Note: Create remote actor is based on application.conf file which says where to create the actor...in which node


### Parallelism using Future
Actor systems is one way to do parallel processing, but sometimes Future can be used to run parallel functions by leveraging multiple CPUs/Java Threads

In this example I simply created a function that will sleep for 5 seconds and ran it one at a time for three times, it took 15 seconds, by Future with 4 CPU machine, it took only 5 seconds

What is the difference between Future versus Actor? 
Future is for running functions in parallel and freely combining them whereas Actors are great for processing many messages, capturing state, and reacting with different behavior based on the state they are in and the messages they receive.They are resilient objects that can live on for a long time even when problems occur, using monitoring and supervision

### Parallelism using AKKA Cluster
AKKA framework comes with a powerful cluster toolkit. Many of the cluster management is taken care by the toolkit. 

When we code in PLSQL or any procedural language we do not care about where it runs, because it aways runs within the database and in the local machine. Whereas in AKKA we can create an application that will run on a cluster of machines

Each machine need to have Java Run Time installed, AKKA libraries installed and our application code deployed. Along with this each node (virual machine) should have application.conf file that will have cluster seed node info to join the cluster

Once we have this setup the actor system can be started with the same name, this will start cluster communication and there will be a leader node and other nodes joining. 

Once cluster is formed we can launch actors locally and on all remote machines and commnication between actors can be carried out by sending messages. This actor structure can be master-with-many-child, peer-to-peer, ring or a complex mesh. 
It can also be a fleet mode where there can be millions of actors that will servr for an entity, for example in a inventory system for several stores there can be an actor for each store-item combination waiting to process inventory transactions

For Proof-of-concept I have created master-many-child type system where seed node will have a receiptionist that will monitor cluster events and track nodes. Also it will wake up periodically to check for inventory transaction file, if one exists it will process line by line and start store-item actor across nodes in a round-robin style, once the file is processed, all actors will be shut down
